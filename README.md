Code for RPi3 Sense Hat in python
Written by me.


# gravity_falls.py
This code creates a square on the LED matrix of input size.
This square can then 'fall' towards the direction it is tilted.
Moving the Joystick Up or Down increases/decreases the size of the square.
Moving the Joystick Left or Right changes the colour in a specific order.

Video will be up soon on youtube.
